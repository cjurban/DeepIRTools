# DeepIRTools

DeepIRTools is a small Python package that uses scalable deep learning methods (e.g., [Urban and Bauer, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11336-021-09748-3)) to fit several kinds of exploratory and confirmatory latent factors models, with a particular focus on item response theory (IRT) models.

## Description

Latent factor models reduce the dimensionality of data by converting a large number of discrete or continuous observed variables (called *items*) into a smaller number of continuous unobserved variables (called *latent factors*), potentially making the data easier to understand. Latent factors models for discrete items are called item response theory (IRT) models.

Traditional IRT estimation methods are computationally intensive when the sample size, the number of items, and the number of latent factors are all large.
